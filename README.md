## Installation üíæ

Cara is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Cara', git: 'https://github.com/icapps/ios-cara.git', commit: '...'
```

_Pass the correct commit reference to make sure your code doesn't break in future updates._

## Features

### Configuration

In order to use the service layer you have to configure it. This can be done by implementing the `Configuration` protocol and passing it to the `Service` init function.

```swift
let configuration: Configuration = SomeConfiguration()
let service = Service(configuration: configuration)
```

Once this is done you are good to go. For more information on what configuration options are available, take a look at the documentation inside the `Configuration.swift` file.

### Trigger a Request

In order to trigger a request you have to do 2 things:
- Create a request that conforms to `Request`.
    
    _The request configuration will be done in this instance. For more information on what options are available, take a look at the documentation inside the `Request.swift` file._

- Create a serializer  that conforms to `Serializer`.

    _The serialization of the response will be done here. You have to implement the `serialize(data:error:response:)` function and this will be called when the response completes._

Once both instances are created and you `Service` is configured, you can execute the request.

```swift
let request: Request = SomeRequest()
let serializer: Serializer = JSONSerializer()
service.execute(request, with: serializer) { response in
    ...
}
```

The `response` returned by the completion block is the same as result of the serializer's `serialize(data:error:response:)` function.

### Serialization

With every request execution you have to pass a serializer. In most cases you will be able to use our `CodableSerializer`, but when you want to define a custom way of serializing your data, there is room for that too.

#### Custom Serializer

Create a custom class that conforms to `Serializer`. Here is a small example of how to do this.

```swift
struct CustomSerializer: Serializer {
    enum Response {
        case .success
        case .failure(Error)
    }

    func serialize(data: Data?, error: Error?, response: URLResponse?) -> Response {
        // data: data returned from the service request
        // error: error returned from the service request
        // response: the service request response

        if let error = error {
            return .failure(error)
        } else {
            return .success
        }
    }
}
```

#### Codable Serializer

We aleady supplied our **Cara** framework with one serializer: the `CodableSerializer`.

This serializer can parse the json data returned from the service to your codable models. Here is an example of a simple `Codable` model:

```swift
class User: Codable {
    let name: String
}
```

Let's now see how we can serialize the result of a request to a single `User` model:

```swift
let request = SomeRequest()
let serializer = CodableSerializer<User>()
service.execute(request, with: serializer) { response in
    switch response {
    case .success(let model):
        // The `model` instance is the parsed user model.
    case .failure(let error):
        // The `error` instance is the error returned from the service request.
    }
    ...
}
```

But what if multiple models are returned? Easy:

```swift
let request = SomeRequest()
let serializer = CodableSerializer<[User]>()
service.execute(request, with: serializer) { response in
    switch response {
    case .success(let models):
        // The `models` array contains the parsed `User` models.
    case .failure(let error):
        // The `error` instance is the error returned from the service request.
    }
    ...
}
```

When required you can pass a custom `JSONDecoder` through the `init`.

## Contribute

### How to contribute ‚ùì

1. Add a Github issue describing the missing functionality or bug.
2. Implement the changes according to the `Swiftlint` coding guidelines.
3. Make sure your changes don't break the current version. (`deprecate` is needed)
4. Fully test the added changes.
5. Send a pull-request.
